Title: Learning Go
Date: Mon Sep 18

I recently had to learn Go. I was on a tight timeline of just about 4 or 5
days. I am familiar with learning Rust, and [Rust by
Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/rust-by-example/), so I found [Go by
Example](https://gobyexample.com/). I found the format wanting for the absolute
beginner level I was at, so I found the absolutely beautiful [A Tour of
Go](https://go.dev/tour/welcome/1) instead. It has links to the official Go
blog for some language features, plus a live playground, which is really great.

I learnt enough to pass a Hackerrank test, which is immensely gratifying :)
It's such a lovely language - very non-threatening syntax and approachable. I
hope to transition out of the embedded space and into pure application/web
development one day, and I hope to use Go that day.
