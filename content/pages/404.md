#### Error 404: Page not found
Sorry, the page you requested was not found.

I have recently updated the URLs of my posts by removing the `.html` at the end. If you
requested one such page, simply redirect yourself to the right page by replacing it
with a `/`. Example:

Old URL (doesn't work):
> `https://gurudas.dev/blog/2023/09/19/learning-go.html`

New URL (works):
> `https://gurudas.dev/blog/2023/09/19/learning-go/`
