🎵 Discovered a new kid on the block, Aniruddh Aithal, who sings brilliantly. Been
listening to his chamber performance of the [Gaud Malhar][c] bandish, _Manan kariye
gori_, on loop.

📚 Reading Pema Chödrön's [Start where you
are](https://pemachodronfoundation.org/product/start-where-you-are-book/). Really
grateful this book exists.

🌤️ It's been a really rough couple of months, so more than the usual amount of
introspection has been taking place. Trying hard to see things with unclouded eyes.
Baseline health has improved, so using that as a solid foundation to return to.
