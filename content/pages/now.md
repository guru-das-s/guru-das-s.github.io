ðŸŽµ Been listening to Pandit Kumar Gandharva's [concert][c] on loop. I did not like
his voice initially, but I found myself returning to this concert again and again,
and also discovered Raga Nat Kamod as a happy side-effect.

A particularly trying period has passed and I'm optimistic about the coming days. A
technique that I've found useful to calm down is to:

1. Say the words out loud: "I choose peace".
    - This I find effective as a bookend to my day: either said out loud first thing
        in the morning, and/or while settling into bed at night.
2. Ask myself in the midst of a tumultuous moment, "what is one thing I can drop
   right now to feel better about instantly?"
    - By "drop" I mean "stop worrying/spiralling about"
    - This is a very newly-discovered technique, not battle-hardened like the first
        one.
