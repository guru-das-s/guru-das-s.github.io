Last Updated: September 2024.

⚒️  I've [finished]({filename}nand-to-tetris-2024-project-5.md) Project 5 of the
[NAND2Tetris course](https://www.nand2tetris.org/)! I've "built" my very own Hack
computer from NAND gates. Working on Project 6 next: building an assembler for the
Hack ISA using Rust.

💻 I've added tags to my blog posts and syntax highlighting to all the code snippets
in them.

🎮 My wife recently gifted me a Sony Playstation 5. A close friend of mine (a
long-time gamer) recommended that I start with [Uncharted
4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncharted_4:_A_Thief%27s_End) as a newbie to console
gaming. I took his suggestion and completed the whole game. He then suggested I check
out [Red Dead Redemption II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Dead_Redemption_2). I
have been _hooked_ to that game ever since I started playing and have already spent
far too many hours on it. Feels good, man.

📖 I've finished reading Frank Herbert's Dune (the first book) on my wife's Kindle
and am looking for something new to read.

🍳 Re-seasoning my cast iron skillet with grapeseed oil. I'd been using avocado oil all
this while, and the seasoning has not been built up because avocado oil has a high
smoke point, and the 420 degrees F that I'd been baking the skillet at does not cause
the oil to polymerize. Grapeseed oil has a smoke point that is close to that
temperature, and the two coats I've added to the pan seem to be sticking well. Third
time lucky - here goes another one.

⚡ I'm experiencing an awakening of sorts and realizing I've been on autopilot for
many years - both at work as well as in life. I am working on making some changes to
align myself more with my true feelings and stop living in fear so much.

☸️  Buddhism seems interesting, in relation to Advaita Vedanta.

🏋🏾 Still working on developing a daily routine involving some physical exercise,
meals at the "proper" times, and adequate sleep at the end of the day.
