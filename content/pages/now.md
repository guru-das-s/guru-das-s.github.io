#### Now

This is a [`/now page`](https://nownownow.com/about).

This is what a portion of my About Me page _used to_ say about what I'm up to now:

> I'm currently working on improving my scripting skills in Python and Bash. I'm also learning Go and Rust.

🏎️ I've joined Tesla as a Linux kernel engineer in the Autopilot AI team! Excited to
work on system software for Tesla vehicles and embark upon a new journey in my
career.

🏠 I've finally moved in with my wife in San Jose, putting an end to all the
long-distancing over the years. Excited to take my learnings from having lived in San
Diego for many years and apply them to loving another city and getting to build my
own memories there with my wife.

⚡ I'm experiencing an awakening of sorts and realizing I've been on autopilot for
many years - both at work as well as in life. I am working on making some changes to
align myself more with my true feelings and stop living in fear so much.

🤖 I'm very proud of this website and am delighted to continue working on it and
adding new features to it. Most of all, I'm excited about writing more blog posts.

💻 I started working on this year's (2023) [Advent of
Code](https://adventofcode.com/2023) and used Rust to solve the first five days of
problems. I learnt a lot and intend to complete at least one more problem-day before
the end of the month. I'm very proud of myself for doing this, and for setting up a
Discord server along with a few friends to keep myself motivated (thanks Nandu for
the wonderful suggestion!).

🏋🏾 Hoping to develop a daily routine involving daily Duolingo lessons (Latin), some
physical exercise, meals at the "proper" times, and adequate sleep at the end of the
day.
