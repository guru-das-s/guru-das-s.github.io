🎵 Youtube does a fantastic job of recommending more Kumar Gandharva to me. I have
been hooked on to his [Surdas bhajans][surdas] (with probably his wife for vocal
support). The guilelessness and honesty to the compositions, the ragas chosen for the
bhajans, his voice, and open throated singing elevate this recording to one of my
all-time favourites. The language is Braj Bhasha, which is new to me.

📚 Started reading a bit of Atul Gawande's _Being Mortal_ and very impressed by the
quality of the writing. Reminds me of the prescribed rules of good writing and the
various admonitions in [the Strunk book][strunk].

🧵🪡🧶✂️  Started learning to crochet using a [Woobles beginner kit][woobles]. Let's
see where this goes.

🚐 My wife and I went on our first RV trip together this Labor Day weekend! We drove
down Highway 395 in a modified RAM Promaster camper van and had a lot of fun.
Sometimes the least prepared-for trips turn out to be unexpectedly thrilling and
memorable - and this was definitely one.
