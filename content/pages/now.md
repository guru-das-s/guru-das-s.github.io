#### Now

This is a [`/now page`](https://nownownow.com/about).

This is what a portion of my About Me page _used to_ say about what I'm up to now:

> I'm currently working on improving my scripting skills in Python and Bash. I'm also learning Go and Rust.

⚒️  I'm working on solving the projects from the first part of the wonderful
[NAND2Tetris course](https://www.nand2tetris.org/). So far I've solved the tasks in
Projects 1 and 2 up until the building the ALU.

⚒️  Even though I started working on last year's (2023) [Advent of
Code (AoC)](https://adventofcode.com/2023), I couldn't find the motivation to continue
working on it beyond Problem-Day 6 in Jan 2024. I'm hoping that one of the capstone
projects in NAND2Tetris (to write an assembler) inspires me to restart AoC - I intend
to use Rust to create my assembler.

📖 I have begun reading Frank Herbert's Dune series on my wife's Kindle. I watched
Denis Villeneuve's movie adaptation (both parts as of Mar 2024) and loved the
world-building and the shadowy, powerful figures depicted in the lore. It's been a
long time since I felt like reading anything, so I'm really excited to rekindle a
hobby that shaped me greatly during my childhood years.

⚡ I'm experiencing an awakening of sorts and realizing I've been on autopilot for
many years - both at work as well as in life. I am working on making some changes to
align myself more with my true feelings and stop living in fear so much.

🤖 Website stuff: Added a `/til` page and published my first TIL.  Added [Facebook
OpenGraph tags](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/sharing/webmasters/) to all my
blog posts and pages and they look so good now! Currently working on a post on the
Eudyptula Challenge.

🫂 I'm being more intentional about staying in touch with friends, mostly old ones.
It really helps that [one of them](https://web.stanford.edu/~mishel/) works right
across the road from me - meeting him for lunch randomly really warms my heart.

🦉 [The green bird](https://www.duolingo.com/) nags me into completing a lesson
daily. Progress is slow, and the lessons could be better structured, but I have
been learning Latin for (_checks app_) 64 days now.

🏋🏾 Still working on developing a daily routine involving some physical exercise,
meals at the "proper" times, and adequate sleep at the end of the day.
