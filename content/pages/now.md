🌐 Moved domain and MX providers:

- Initially bought this domain from Google Domains
- That got shut down and all domains got transferred to Squarespace
- Wanted custom email address at the time, so signed up for Google Workspace
- Google Workspace is *expensive* if all one wants is a custom email address and
    not the other bells and whistles such as domain-private Meet, Drive, Docs, et
    c.
- Searched for other options, settled on Spacemail.
- Thought it would be easier to consolidate domain management with the provider
    of mail services too, so moved to Spaceship.
- Spacemail is cheap and offers more mailboxes (custom email addresses on same
    domain) but its Android app does not have instant email notifications like
    GMail does
- "Instant email notifications" needs Firebase. Spacemail only has IMAP IDLE,
    which is a kind of polling mechanism
- Installed betterbird on my Arch laptop and Thunderbird on my
    Android phone to handle mail.
- Setting IMAP Idle and mail frequency to fast values is working for me.

🦬 Started using emacs Org Mode at work to track my To-Do lists

- Second time giving Org Mode a go and it has been amazing to make sense of the
    chaos
- Love the status-change, auto-sort, hiding, tagging features that work out of
    the box, and the keybindings too
- Helpful to log work done weekly at the end of the week.
- Haven't started using the other features of emacs though.
- Also I use evil mode, so that's not really the *true* emacs experience, but
    this works well for me.

🐧 Looking to get back into Linux kernel upstream work

- I miss the thrill of posting patches upstream and receiving feedback from
    maintainers and getting patches accepted
- Feel like an outsider now that it's been a couple of years since I posted last
- Want to start looking at avenues I can contribute given that I have experience
    with many new subsystems thanks to work

🏠 Bought a house, yay!

- Doesn't feel very different yet, it takes a while to sink in I guess

⌨️  Touch typing is a neat hack to actually improve productivity and the feeling of
being productive:

- Using the little finger to hit `:` is a game changer (used ring finger until now)
- Want to learn it properly now - I still don't use it to hit `P`

🤖 Started a Perplexity Pro subscription

- Their alternative to Google Assistant is great.
- Tried Comet browser too but it does not have password import yet
- Their reduced-features-browser that opens links without opening a new browser
    instance needs improvement - does not open links within the opened link. Maybe
    I'm holding it wrong.

🚀 Claude Code is awesome.

- A new era dawns. Getting the distinct feeling that a paradigm shift has taken place
    in software development.
- I feel that hand-coding by reading docs, manuals and figuring stuff out sans AI will eventually
    become a superpower of the past, much like how programming in assembly has become
    a yesteryear superpower.
- The image of Paul Atreides seeking to ride the sandworm comes to mind.

💪🏽 The OODA loop

- Observe
- Orient
- Decide
- Act
- I tend to get stuck in analysis-paralysis loops and this decision-making tool is helpful.
- Setting a tight loop forces me to take a best-efforts decision and move on to the
    next task.
