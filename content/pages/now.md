#### Now

This is a [`/now page`](https://nownownow.com/about).

This is what a portion of my About Me page _used to_ say about what I'm up to now:

> I'm currently working on improving my scripting skills in Python and Bash. I'm also learning Go and Rust.

🏠 I've quit my old job and am driving up the coast of California to the Bay Area
with my wife. I've got the rest of the month off - a well-deserved break before I
join my new job in the new year, woohoo! 🎉🎊 I have a trip to the Grand Canyon in
the offing too.

⚡ I'm experiencing an awakening of sorts and realizing I've been on autopilot for
many years - both at work as well as in life. I am working on making some changes to
align myself more with my true feelings and stop living in fear so much.

🤖 I'm very proud of this website and am delighted to continue working on it and
adding new features to it. Most of all, I'm excited about writing more blog posts.

💻 I started working on this year's (2023) [Advent of
Code](https://adventofcode.com/2023) and used Rust to solve the first five days of
problems. I learnt a lot and intend to complete at least one more problem-day before
I join my new job. I'm very proud of myself for doing this, and setting up a Discord
server along with a few friends to keep myself motivated (thanks Nandu for the
wonderful suggestion!).

🏋🏾 My longest gym streak was one month this year.
