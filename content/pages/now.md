Last Updated: January 2025.

⚒️  I've [finished]({filename}/blog/nand-to-tetris-2024-project-7.md) Project 7 of the
[NAND2Tetris course](https://www.nand2tetris.org/). I've built half of the VM
Translator in Rust. This is a really great step forward for me, and I'm quite proud
of myself for reaching thus far.

💻 I finally got the footer of this website to stay at the bottom even when there is
not enough content to fill a screenful. I uploaded the CSS files I use to Perplexity
AI (three files max in the free tier) and asked it to fix my long-standing problem.
It promptly [gave me the code][perpl] and put a great big smile of satisfaction on my
face.

🎮 Still playing and enjoying [Red Dead Redemption
II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Dead_Redemption_2).

📖 Waiting for Manu S. Pillai's new book, [Gods, Guns and Missionaries: The Making of
the Modern Hindu Identity][manu] to be made available in the US on Kindle.

🏋🏾 Been semi-regular with physical exercise. Working my way towards being able to
do a few pull-ups by the end of the year. Started with dead hangs and scapular
pull-ups.
