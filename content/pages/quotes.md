Get busy livin', or get busy dyin'.

This quote from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shawshank_Redemption">The Shawshank Redemption</a>
can be interpreted in a couple of ways:
<ol>
<li>As a powerful wake-up call to be fully mentally present and alive to the
possibilities of the moment amidst the maelstrom of daily mundane life - are we
really <i>living</i> or just existing, going through the motions?
<li>As a tacit injunction to not waste time half-assing being alive but to really
whole-ass it, mustering up verve and vigour to "once more unto the breach" that
sucker.
</ol>

അനേകശാസ്ത്രം ബഹു വേദിതവ്യം അല്പശ്ച കാലോ ബഹവശ്ച വിഘ്നാഃ
</summary>
യത് സാരഭൂതം തദുപാസിതവ്യം ഹംസോ യഥാ ക്ഷീരമിവാമ്പുമധ്യാത് <br>
<blockquote>
Many are the <i>shastras</i> (bodies of knowledge), there is so much to be learnt;<br>
Scarce runs Time and obstacles (to learning) abound;<br>
(Only) that (<i>shastra</i>) which is essential is what one should devote oneself
to,<br>
just as the Swan (discerningly devotes itself to/drinks) milk from a
water-dilution.<br>
</blockquote>
This motif of the milk-drinking swan is canon in the Vedic corpus.

by Walt Whitman. After painting the starkest and direst images of quotidian drudgery
and institutional failure, Walt breaks the fourth wall of Dickensian smog and
invitingly extends towards us an open palm bearing a wee sapling of promise and
responsibility.

Success leads to complacency; complacency to failure; failure to
humility; and humility, back to success.
</summary>
Found this useful when I was going through the interviewing grind for software
development roles. I felt like I got complacent in a previous role and decided that I
would learn something on the side in my next role to keep things fresh. Been
successful in this endeavour so far.
