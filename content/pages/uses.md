tldr: Tools Guru Das Srinagesh uses on a daily basis to get work done

<h4> Uses </h4>

This is a [`/uses page`](https://uses.tech/) and, as such, talks about the tools I use on a daily basis to get work done.

# Hardware

Personal:

1. Dell XPS 13 9343: One of the earliest XPS 13 models; I bought this in 2015.
2. Google Pixel 8
3. Pixel earbuds

Work:

1. Apple Macbook Pro (15 in)
3. Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic Keyboard
    - Microsoft has apparently discontinued production of this keyboard now
    - Highly recommend!

# Software I use

I run Arch Linux with Gnome as my desktop environment on my XPS 13.

1. `vim`
2. `ag`, [the silver searcher](https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher) and [my fork](https://github.com/guru-das-s/ag.vim) of its vim [integration script](https://github.com/rking/ag.vim)
3. Firefox
4. `tmux`
5. `mutt`
6. `b4`
7. [Betterbird](https://www.betterbird.eu/)
8. Thunderbird Android app
9. Firefox [Ctrl+Number to switch tabs extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ctrl-number-to-switch-tabs/)

For work, I use mostly the above tools on Ubuntu, along with these nifty tools that
make my life easier:

1. `emacs` Org mode
2. [Preservim's vim-markdown plugin](https://github.com/preservim/vim-markdown)
    - The `conceallevel`, `InsertToc` and syntax highlighting are all top-notch
      features. `InsertToc` requires `Tabular` to work and it does a superb job.

# Camera equipment and software
1. I use a Fujifilm X-T10 that has been my faithful companion since 2017.
2. Lenses:
    - Stock Fuji 18-55 mm: I hardly use this.
    - Rokinon 12 mm f/2.0 prime: for astrophotography
    - Fuji 35 mm f/2.0 prime: my daily driver and most used lens
    - Fuji XF 56 mm F1.2 R
3. Promaster tripod
4. My Dell XPS 13 9343 has an SD card reader built-in, which is _extremely_ convenient.
4. [darktable](https://www.darktable.org/) to process RAW photos.

# Everyday Carry (EDC)
1. Benchmade Mini Bugout knife
2. Seiko SKX013/Sinn 104
3. Bespoke Post's Line of Trade [Slim Wallet](https://www.bespokepost.com/store/line-of-trade-slim-wallet)
4. Gerber Shard tool
5. [P-7 Suspension Clip](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00L75GRX6?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title&th=1)
