#### Uses

This is a [`/uses page`](https://uses.tech/) and, as such, talks about the tools I use on a daily basis to get work done.

##### Hardware

Personal:

> 1. Dell XPS 13 9343: One of the earliest XPS 13 models; I bought this in 2015.
2. Google Pixel 8
3. Bose Companion 2 wired speakers

Work:

> 1. Apple Macbook Pro (15 in)

##### Software I use

I run Arch Linux with Gnome as my desktop environment on my XPS 13.

> 1. `vim`
2. `ag`, [the silver searcher](https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher) and its vim [integration script](https://github.com/rking/ag.vim)
3. Google Chrome
4. `tmux`

For work, I use Mac OS.
