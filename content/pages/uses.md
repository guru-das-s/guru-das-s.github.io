tldr: Tools Guru Das Srinagesh uses on a daily basis to get work done

#### Uses

This is a [`/uses page`](https://uses.tech/) and, as such, talks about the tools I use on a daily basis to get work done.

##### Hardware

Personal:

1. Dell XPS 13 9343: One of the earliest XPS 13 models; I bought this in 2015.
2. Google Pixel 8
3. Bose Companion 2 wired speakers

Work:

1. Apple Macbook Pro (15 in)
2. [EPOS EOS 560 headphones](https://www.eposaudio.com/en/us/products/adapt-500)
3. Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic Keyboard
    - Microsoft has apparently discontinued production of this keyboard now
    - Highly recommend!

##### Software I use

I run Arch Linux with Gnome as my desktop environment on my XPS 13.

1. `vim`
2. `ag`, [the silver searcher](https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher) and [my fork](https://github.com/guru-das-s/ag.vim) of its vim [integration script](https://github.com/rking/ag.vim)
3. Google Chrome
4. `tmux`

For work, I use mostly the above tools on Ubuntu, along with these nifty tools that
make my life easier:

1. [todotxt](http://todotxt.org/) and its [todotxt-cli client](https://github.com/todotxt/todo.txt-cli) in particular
    - Fantastic, minimalist todo list manager
2. [Preservim's vim-markdown plugin](https://github.com/preservim/vim-markdown)
    - The `conceallevel`, `InsertToc` and syntax highlighting are all top-notch
      features. `InsertToc` requires `Tabular` to work and it does a superb job.

##### Google Chrome Extensions

1. [uBlock Origin](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm?pli=1)
2. [GoFullPage - Full Page Screen Capture](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/gofullpage-full-page-scre/fdpohaocaechififmbbbbbknoalclacl)
3. [Rich URL](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/rich-url/bkjdcppkdgccnhjibfhlhmeiafnjfamk) to copy the current tab, [Edge-style](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/improved-copy-and-paste-of-urls-in-microsoft-edge-d3bd3956-603a-0033-1fbc-9588a30645b4). This grabs the title of the current tab and hyperlinks the actual URL to it as well.
4. [Vimium](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/vimium/dbepggeogbaibhgnhhndojpepiihcmeb) - use Vim keybindings in the browser!
5. [Google Input Tools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-input-tools/mclkkofklkfljcocdinagocijmpgbhab) to type in Indic languages

##### Camera equipment and software
1. I use a Fujifilm X-T10 that has been my faithful companion since 2017.
2. Lenses:
    - Stock Fuji 18-55 mm: I hardly use this.
    - Rokinon 12 mm f/2.0 prime: for astrophotography
    - Fuji 35 mm f/2.0 prime: my daily driver and most used lens
    - Fuji XF 56 mm F1.2 R
3. Promaster tripod
4. My Dell XPS 13 9343 has an SD card reader built-in, which is _extremely_ convenient.
4. [darktable](https://www.darktable.org/) to process RAW photos.

##### Everyday Carry (EDC)
1. Benchmade Mini Bugout knife
2. Seiko SKX013/Sinn 104
3. Bespoke Post's Line of Trade [Slim Wallet](https://www.bespokepost.com/store/line-of-trade-slim-wallet)
4. Gerber Shard tool
